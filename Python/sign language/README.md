# 🖐️ Sign Language Detection using Machine Learning

A real-time **Sign Language Detection System** built using **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning** techniques to bridge the communication gap between the hearing-impaired community and others. This project recognizes hand gestures and converts them into readable **text** or **speech**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎥 Real-time hand gesture detection using a webcam  
- 🤖 Deep Learning–based gesture recognition  
- 💬 Converts signs into text (and optionally speech)  
- 🌐 Easy to integrate into desktop or web applications  
- 🧠 Customizable — train it for any sign language (ASL, ISL, etc.)

## 🧩 Tech Stack

| Category | Tools/Technologies |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Programming Language | Python |
| Libraries | OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, MediaPipe, NumPy |
| Model Type | CNN / LSTM (for sequence-based gestures) |
| Interface | Streamlit / Tkinter / Flask (optional for GUI) |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Capture Input** – The system takes live video feed from the webcam.  
2. **Preprocess Frames** – Detects and isolates the hand region using MediaPipe or OpenCV.  
3. **Feature Extraction** – Extracts important features like hand landmarks or contours.  
4. **Model Prediction** – A trained deep learning model classifies the gesture.  
5. **Output** – The recognized sign is displayed as text (and optionally spoken aloud).

## 🧠 Model Training

1. **Dataset Collection:**  
   Capture multiple images of each gesture (A–Z or custom words).  
2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Resize images, normalize pixel values, and apply augmentation.  
3. **Model Architecture:**  
   A CNN model is trained on labeled gesture data.  
4. **Evaluation:**  
   Test the model on unseen gestures and fine-tune parameters.
